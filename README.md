# A Command and Control (C2) Framework
# with Advanced Features for debian based Linux distributions

In today's digital world, the development of Command and Control (C2) frameworks has become a significant
aspect of cybercrime and security research. These frameworks offer the ability to control and monitor computer
and network systems, and are of great interest to malicious actors and security experts alike. This essay
explores a C2 framework that offers various advanced features, including upload and download functions,
browser data theft, keylogger functionality, webcam access, ransomware capability, automatic port-forwarding
tunnels through the Tor network, and a zip function for files and folders.

Undetected Payload generator:
This C2 Framework has a built in payload generator for undetected payloads

Upload and Download Functions:
This C2 framework allows the attacker to upload and download files to and from the infected system. These
functions can be used for distributing malware or exfiltrating sensitive data.

Steal Browser Data Function:
An extremely invasive feature of this framework is the ability to steal browser data from infected systems.
This includes bookmarks, passwords, credit cards and browsing history. The stolen information can be used
for identity theft or other malicious purposes.

Keylogger Function:
The C2 framework includes a keylogger function, enabling the recording of user keystrokes. This allows the
attacker to intercept sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, and confidential communication.

Webcam Access: A particularly concerning feature of this framework is the ability to access the infected
system's webcam. This allows the attacker to surreptitiously monitor and record video and audio of the victims.

Ransomware Function: The C2 framework contains a ransomware function that encrypts files on the infected system
and demands a ransom. Ransomware attacks are one of the most significant threats to data security and can cause
substantial harm.

Automatic Port Forwarding through the Tor Network:
To maintain anonymity and evade detection, the framework can automatically set up port-forwarding tunnels through
the Tor network. This enables the attacker to establish connections to and from infected systems without being
easily identified.

Zip Function for Files and Folders:
With this feature, files and folders on the infected system can be compressed and packed into zip archives. This
facilitates the transfer of large amounts of data and concealing malicious content.
